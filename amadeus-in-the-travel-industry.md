## Overall travel volumes

The contribution of travel and tourism to the world economy is estimated at USD 8.8 trillion, or more than 10% of the global GDP. This industry currently supports 319 million jobs - almost 1 in 10 globally. 1

For eight consecutive years, the travel and tourism sector has outpaced global economic growth. The direct contribution of travel and tourism to GDP in 2018 was USD 2.8 trillion (3.2% of GDP). This is forecast to rise by 3.6% in 2019. 1

From 2019 to 2029, the direct contribution of travel and tourism to GDP is expected to grow at an annual compound rate of 3.6%. 1

Air traffic measured in terms of Revenue Passenger Kilometer (RPK) is expected to grow at an average 4.3% p.a. in the next 20 years. 2 Hospitality is also growing at a healthy rate, with a 9% increase in number of rooms worldwide between 2014 and 2018. 3

## Regional development

Developments in the travel sector will be very uneven across different regions of the world.

Growth in the travel industry is particularly strong in Asia-Pacific, the Middle East and Africa, with travel and tourism direct GDP expected to grow at compound annual rates of 5.3%, 3.8% and 4.2% respectively. Latin America region is expected to grow at a compound annual rate of 3.1% during the same period.

On the other hand, Europe and North America are expected to grow at an annual rate of 2.3% and 2.6% respectively. 1

Looking at air traffic, the same picture emerges, with Asia-Pacific and the Middle East expected to grow at a compounded annual rate of 5.5% and Africa and Latin America at around 4.8% and 4.3% respectively, with more moderate growth of 3.3% and 3.0% for Europe and North America respectively. 4

As a consequence of these regional growth differentials, the center of gravity in the travel world will shi/ft from west to east, with Asia-Pacific being the major growth catalyst. By 2024 China will have displaced the US as the world's largest aviation market, 5 driven by continued robust economic growth, an upsurge in middle-income households and an increase in first-time flyers. By 2030 three out of four of the largest aviation passenger markets will be in Asia. Indeed, out of 44,000 airplanes projected to be delivered over the next 20 years, 17,000 will be to Asian markets. 6 This growth is supported by the increase in airports in the region: between 2012 and 2018, where the net number of new airports worldwide was 176, a full 165 of these were in the Asia-Pacific region. 6 And looking forward, China is aiming to build 200 new airports by 2035, 7 and India 100 by 2025. 8

Amadeus is well positioned to capitalize on this AsiaPacific growth. We have a wide local presence and a workforce of close to 4,300 people in the region,

11

representing 22% of our total workforce. ↩ We also have a strong market position in the distribution business and many important carriers as customers in our Airline IT business.

## Trends with a potential to impact travel volumes

Expected travel volumes can be affected by geopolitical events, economic growth levels, capacity constraints, the evolution of multimodal travel, and sustainability issues.

## Geopolitics

Geopolitical and security events in certain parts of the world are affecting travel significantly.

Political tensions and an increased level of protectionism are affecting travel negatively. Indeed, in 2018 the International Air Transport Association (IATA) projected significant differences in the growth of air travel over the next 20 years under a base case scenario ('Constant Policy': 3.5% growth p.a.) and two extreme scenarios ('Reverse Globalization': 2.4% p.a.; 'Maximum Liberalization': 5.5% p.a.). 9 In terms of number of passengers in 2037, this shows a difference of a factor of almost two between the best- and worst-case scenarios by the end of the period.

At the same time, threats of terrorism are leading to restrictions on travel, increased security and border control, and an increased administrative burden on the traveler. This, coupled with a reduced appetite for travel, can have a dampening effect on demand. But experience has shown that security issues tend to only affect specific countries or regions and are generally short-lived. In addition, Amadeus' high geographical diversification helps to limit the impact of such issues on our business. Technology has provided solutions for security issues in the past, and this is likely to continue, presenting a further

## Impact of COVID-19

At the time of this report going to print, the travel industry is being severely affected by the impact and spread of COVID-19, the coronavirus. It is difficult to predict how long this situation will last or what the consequences for the global economy will be, and we are monitoring the situation closely. We've established dedicated teams to ensure the well-being of our employees, as well as support for our customers. Some of the measures taken include the accelerated delivery of products and services that help our airline customers be in constant contact with travelers and travel agencies, using Amadeus' advertising space to regularly provide updates. Our technical support teams remain available to help our customers keep servicing travelers, and our technology solutions enable replacing face-to-face interactions with virtual solutions wherever this is required, e.g. in work-from-home situations. We are taking necessary precautionary measures to reduce costs and protect our financial position and to ensure business continuity through this crisis, and to be able to resume activities as quickly as possible when the situation is normalized.

opportunity for large travel IT providers with the required scale and reach such as Amadeus.

## Economic growth

Economic growth levels have a significant impact on travel industry growth. For example, the 20-year median growth rate of air passengers in terms of passenger kilometers flown is just above 2 times that of the global GDP, 10 although this multiplier varies substantially over time and from one region to another. So future economic recessions or upturns will have a strong impact on travel volumes.

## Capacity constraints

The increase in travel is leading to strains on travel infrastructure, and in particular on airports. In 2019, 204 airports were designated Level 3 slot-coordinated facilities, meaning that they do not have the runway, ramp or gate capacity to handle all of the flights that carriers would like to operate. 11 At the same time, despite the strong investments in airports, long-term demand in Europe is expected to exceed capacity. 12 Likewise, pilot shortages could be a large challenge for the industry. 13 As technology can facilitate more efficient use of these scarce resources, the industry will need to invest in IT systems.

## Multimodal travel

Multimodal travel means using different modes of transport for a particular itinerary. It is gaining ground not just because there's an increasing demand for seamless door-to-door travel, but also because governmental agencies and transport authorities are seeing an opportunity to reduce carbon emissions as well as alleviate congestion and pollution. The extent to which travel supply chains can integrate multimodal transport services into a one-search, oneticket, one-click purchase could boost future travel volumes.

The European Union declaration of 2018 as the Year of Multimodality 14 is a clear illustration of policy intent to support 'onestop shop' technology that can enable the sale of multimodal travel. Amadeus' strong presence in travel positions us well to synchronize solutions with this emerging trend.

In fact, Amadeus has been working with the European Commission on multimodality projects for some years now. Among other projects, we've been involved in Shi/ft 2 Rail and All Ways Travelling. As a facilitator of connectivity, Amadeus is in a unique position to make multimodality a reality, which we are committed to.

## Sustainability

The travel and tourism sector faces issues such as overcrowded destinations, income inequalities and human-induced climate variability. The climate issue in particular has received much more attention over recent years. Social movements like 'flight-shaming' have attracted unprecedented attention, and the industry needs to respond with facts and action. We expect a more specific and strict legal framework on these and other issues to emerge, which could have a negative impact on travel.

In regards to aviation, however, the industry is determined to grow sustainably, committing to cutting net emissions to half the 2005 levels by 2050. 15 As such, many airlines have taken an active role in addressing this issue. For example, EasyJet have announced that they will offset the emissions of all of their flights. 16 And technology from IT companies such as Amadeus can contribute to the more efficient use of infrastructure and energy. ↩

## The need for technology to support the evolution of the travel industry

The evolution and growth of the industry is highly dependent on technology.

For travel providers to succeed in today's world, a strong focus is required not only on cost efficiencies but also on revenue

maximization, as well as brand and customer loyalty. In this context, technology also plays an important role in enhancing a wide variety of core operations for travel providers. Amadeus has IT offerings for, among others, airlines, hotels and airports. ↩ 1

The travel ecosystem consists of countless providers - airlines, hotels, railways, car rental companies, destination services providers, etc. - as well as countless travel sellers. Technology is powering the ecosystem by connecting all these different travel providers, allowing travelers to search for and book the optimal journey, consisting perhaps of several travel services (e.g. air, hotel and car). Amadeus plays an important role in powering this ecosystem via our distribution business, which connects travel providers with travel sellers all over the world. ↩ 2

The inconveniences sometimes linked to travel can be a significant impediment in the evolution of the travel industry. However, recent and emerging technologies could help all actors deliver a more frictionless experience. For example:

- \_ Travelers' journeys have different physical checkpoints all along the trip. Typically, repetitive ID checks create frustration on the traveler side, as well as cost increases, inefficiency and revenue losses on the airline and airport side. Providing a digital identity tightly linked to the user's physical identity can enable a more seamless and personalized processing of the traveler while increasing security in travel touchpoints. Amadeus is exploring solutions and technologies to simplify the traveler's identification throughout the entire journey. This involves a unique and certified digital identity controlled by the traveler, who can then also benefit from hyper-personalized services.
- \_ The use of artificial intelligence makes it possible to fine-tune search results based on the traveler's explicit and implicit preferences to create highly personalized and contextual offers for their next flight, hotel room or car rental. Artificial intelligence can also improve travel actors' operations by predicting the unexpected and pro-actively proposing relevant solutions in case something goes wrong. The potential annual efficiency gains from artificial intelligence are significant and could reach USD 400 billion for the travel industry alone. 17 Amadeus is researching new artificial intelligence technologies to enhance the travel experience.

↩ 1 See 'Business lines,' p. 20. ↩ 2 See 'Distribution,' p. 22.

- \_ The Internet of Things - and more generally, connecting objects, data, processes and people - is expected to become a major technology trend. Amadeus is working on use cases for the travel industry, like asset tracking (e.g. tracking of luggage).
- \_ Other emerging technologies like FPGA, 18 augmented/virtual reality and robotics also have the potential to impact our industry.

Amadeus is supporting travel industry growth with significant investment in technology. Amadeus has spent 17.7% of revenues on R&D in 2019 (€988 million) and it is ranked as the second-largest R&D investor in the so/ftware industry in Europe. 19

## Where we've come from our history and key milestones

Amadeus was formed in 1987 by our four founding airlines: Air France, Iberia, Lu/fthansa and SAS. From our origins supporting airline distribution and then IT, we gradually expanded our capabilities to serve customers across the entire travel industry. Fast-forward three decades, and Amadeus has become one of the world's largest technology providers for travel and tourism.

Over the years, we've broadened our scope, launching our Airline IT business in 2000 and building on that with the acquisition of Navitaire in 2016 to broaden our offerings for low-cost carriers.

We accelerated our move into the hotel IT sector with the acquisition of Newmarket in 2014. Our acquisition of TravelClick in 2018 confirmed our strong commitment to the hospitality industry, broadening our product portfolio, know-how and global presence. In a highly fragmented market, Amadeus now has the people and the technology to help all hoteliers rise to the challenge of delivering a great experience for their guests.

We've also expanded our portfolio to include merchandizing, revenue management, travel intelligence and travel expense management, harnessing the potential of cloud computing, mobile applications and big data for our customers.

Throughout our history, investment in research and development has been integral to our growth.
